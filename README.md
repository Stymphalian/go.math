# Introduction
A package for matrix math stuff.
I plan on using it when I do computer graphics stuff with Go,
so many of the choices I make will be so that it can work with OpenGL

# Goals
 * I really wanted to play around with go-lang.I thought it would be a 'good'
 idea to create some small math package to get better use to the language.  
 Specific things I want to learn about go
    1. How the package structure works
    2. Go development workflow
    3. Package depolyment
    4. Learn about the type stystem and the relationships between objects.
 * I want the package to have support for quaternions and the ability to specify
 rotations using a variety of methods.(axis-angle, euler angles, rotatation matrices, quaternions)
 I want to implement the functionality myself because I've always wanted to know how 
 rotations/quaternions work internally.
