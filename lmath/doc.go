// lmath is a small 3D linear algebra library which provides support for
// Vec3, Mat4 and Quaternions. Also supports rotations using euler angles,
// axis-angle, rotation matrix, and quaternions as well as conversion between them
package lmath

// Conventions
// Right-Hand coordinate system
// All angles are specified in Radians
